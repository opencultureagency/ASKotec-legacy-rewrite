# #ASKotec

## Access to Skills and Knowledge – Open Tech Emergency Case/Kit

### Intro

What is needed to train young people and what is the mission?

Freely shareable and collaboration based Open Technologies are a form of Open
Source content that can also act as accelerators for peace and empowerment.

The #ASKotec kit is designed to work as a mobile trainer‘s set to tackle basic field
challenges   when   it   comes   to   Open   Tech   and   Open   Source   Hardware   innovation,
education and repairing wherever needed. Providing »Access to Skills and Knowledge«
as an multi-functional »Open Tech Emergency Case« gives rural and urban innovators
a new point of entrance.

A kit with basic tools and materials to distribute knowledge and product development.
As well as up-cycling old material to new #open innovation ...anywhere!

#### The set contains

- basic electronics and connections

- soldering and cutting tools

- mechanical and measurement tools

- Guides and additional things (ex. adapters, first aid kit and additional things)

- (optional) A Linux computer and documentation content

### Context

Where did it came from and how is it used in action?
Starting with an overarching question: Where there is extremely limited access to
basic infrastructures such as proper shelter, electricity and internet, what does it take
to become a trainer and run your own workshop for Open Tech innovation, repair and
up-cycling of existing resources? #ASKotec was developed in the context and by the
participants of the Let‘s Go jHUB #LGJ project by icebauhaus, r0g_agency and KAPITAL
on enabling  access to media and information. Supported by the German Federal
Ministry   of   Economic   Cooperation   and   Development   (BMZ)   and   backed   by   Open
Source Ecology activists, implemented in South Sudan and Uganda.

By using the former created #OLG (Open Learning Guide) to promote and develop
OERs (Open Educational Resources) and a self setup Linux laptop to give free access
to   knowledge   a   new   stage   was   tested.   Practical skills   are  the  next   approach.
By training people in Open Tech a new Guide was developed to support the #ASKotec
field concept. It is called the Open Hardware Guide #OHG.

With the help and empirical testing by local people from South Sudan and Uganda,
examples for small Open Tech solutions, like a rechargeable LED light or a solar 5V
USB mobile charging device the #OHG gives hands on information on how to innovate #opentech4all.

### Evolution

What‘s the status and how can it be improved or refined/advanced?

Being a prototype of the first hour, this kit provided as a dust proof case is meant to
be further developed. It already is on an ongoing journey of field tests in South Sudan
and Uganda. The content is still not fully obtainable on site and this gives the first
additional challenge to solve as well as to locate possible improvements regarding the
specific local needs and situations.
